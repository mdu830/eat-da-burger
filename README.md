### Description: 

<ul>
    When the user submits a burger they would like to eat, the application displays it on the left of the screen with a "devour" button. When devoured, the burger is then moved to the right of the screen into a list of previously devoured burgers. All burgers devoured or not, are saved to a mySQL database deployed on heroku.
